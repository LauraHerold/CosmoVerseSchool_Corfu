# CosmoVerseSchool_Corfu

Material for the lecture "From LCDM to Early Dark Energy" at the [2024 CosmoVerse summer school on Corfu](https://cosmoversetensions.eu/event/cosmoverseschoolcorfu/).

The lecture will include two hands-on sessions. Both sessions include coding exercises, for which you have two options: 

1. Google Colab: For this option, you don't need to install any code on your computer but you will need a [Google account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en). Follow the links below to the Google colab notebooks and copy these notebooks to your Google Drive. Edit only your version (you won't be able to save modifications to the template)!

2. Local jupyter notebooks: Make sure you installed [CLASS](https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public/tree/master) and [CLASS_EDE](https://github.com/mwt5345/class_ede) following the instructions on the respective websites. Then download the notebooks "Notebook_1.ipynb", "Notebook_2.ipnb" and `plik_lite` folder to your computer or clone the whole repo.

## Overview:

- Lecture 1: Theory from￼LCDM to EDE
  
- Hands-on Session 1: Composition and evolution of the universe with `CLASS`
